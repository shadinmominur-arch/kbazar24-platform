## 🔴 OPEN — Critical

### C_CONCERN: pa_concern — HIGH+MED applied, LOW+SKIP awaiting manual review
**Updated 2026-05-21:** 2,235 → **2,480** products now have pa_concern (68%).
**Applied:** 245 products (HIGH:1 MED:244) × 376 concern assignments. Rollback: `pa-concern-rollback-20260521-174257.sql`
**Post-apply concern counts:** dryness-hydration:787, acne-blemish:529, sensitivity:435, anti-aging-repair:353, hyperpigmentation:346, brightening:338, sunscreen:306, wrinkle:295, pores-blackheads:234
**Remaining gap:** ~1,161 products still without concern — manual review CSV ready:
  `workspace/audit/active/pa-concern-manual-review-20260521-174247.csv` (1,161 rows)
  — 353 LOW-confidence rows: concern already suggested, just approve/change/skip
  — 603 no-signal rows (korean-beauty only, no sub-category): suggestion column filled
  — 205 confirmed SKIP (hair/makeup/non-skin): keep as SKIP or override
**How to apply reviewed rows:** edit `review_action` column → APPROVE, then run `pa-concern-apply.py` on filtered CSV
**Logic note:** korean-beauty alone is NOT used as a concern signal — products only in that category need manual assignment or a specific sub-category.

### ~~C2: Homepage title trim~~ ✅ DONE
Title = "Emart Skincare Bangladesh | Korean & Global Beauty" — 50 chars, verified live 2026-05-21.

## 🟡 OPEN — Medium

### M4: FAQ answer quality — top products use templated answers
**Evidence:** Multiple products return generic "Apply as directed for this product type…" answers
**Impact:** FAQPage schema present but thin answers reduce rich-result quality score
**Fix:** Re-generate FAQ for top 200 SKUs using product-specific inputs. Verify first 10 manually before bulk run.
**Storage/rendering:** Product FAQs are stored in Woo post meta `_emart_product_faq`; frontend reads that meta in `apps/web/src/app/shop/[slug]/page.tsx` and renders the same content as visible FAQ + FAQPage JSON-LD. Do **not** store product FAQs in ingredient/concern page files.
**Generation inputs required:** product name, brand, categories, ingredients (`_emart_ingredients`, Woo ingredient meta, or product attributes), skin type tags, concern tags, how-to-use (`_emart_how_to_use` or short description), origin, size, price, and current product URL.
**Output contract:** exactly 5 Q/A pairs, mixed English + Bangla, product-specific, no delivery/COD/site-policy answers, no unsupported medical claims, no invented benefits. Include authenticity, use-case, how-to-use, skin-type fit, and caution/who-should-avoid themes.
**Execution notes for Claude Code:** Use OpenRouter credentials from local secure credential file if LLM generation is needed, but never commit credentials/API keys. WordPress/Woo/local DB credentials may exist on the VPS; read them from secure local config only, never copy them into scripts, logs, reports, or commits.
**Verification gate:** Generate a review report for top 10 first, manually inspect for product specificity, then apply top 10 only. If approved, generate/apply top 200. Remaining catalog is a separate sprint.
**Effort:** Large — Woo meta mutation task; dry-run/review/apply required.
**Owner:** Confirm top-10 review output before any bulk apply.

### M6: Ingredient + concern education content refinement
**Updated 2026-05-21:** Initial long-form blocks already exist and render above product grids.
**Current state:**
- 15 ingredient pages have `apps/web/src/data/ingredient-content.json` entries, ~1,560 words each, 6 H2 sections + 5 FAQs.
- 9 concern pages have `apps/web/src/data/concern-content.json` entries, ~1,500 words each, 6 H2 sections + 5 FAQs.
- Frontend renders them through `EducationContent` in `apps/web/src/app/ingredients/[slug]/page.tsx` and `apps/web/src/app/concerns/[slug]/page.tsx`.
**Remaining gaps:**
- FAQ content is visible but ingredient/concern pages do **not** emit FAQPage JSON-LD for those education FAQs yet.
- Content is too templated across pages; it needs more ingredient/concern-specific detail and safer factual nuance.
- Ingredient pages currently have 0 internal links in the education copy.
- Concern pages currently have only ~3 ingredient links and 0 routine links; target is at least 5 ingredient links + 3 routine-step links where natural.
**Fix:** Refinement sprint, not a fresh build. First update `niacinamide`, `hyaluronic-acid`, `acne-blemish-care`, and `dryness-hydration`; add FAQPage JSON-LD; improve internal links and reduce templated phrasing. Review live before bulk-updating the remaining pages.
**Effort:** Medium-large — content + small schema render patch.
**Owner:** Warlord review required after first 4 pages before bulk.

## 🔵 OPEN — Needs Owner Decision Before Starting

### O1: `/origins/[country]` editorial content
Routes/indexing are already handled: `/origins/[country]` pages are live, sitemap includes origin URLs, and `/origins?country=X` redirects to `/origins/X` per 2026-05-21 verification.
**Current content state:** only `south-korea`, `japan`, and `usa` have editorial content in `apps/web/src/lib/origin-editorial.ts`.
**Remaining gap:** Other origin pages are product grids with minimal story/header copy. Add 600+ word country-specific editorial content where the country has meaningful catalog depth.
**Priority:** South Korea/Japan/USA exist; next candidates should be chosen by product count and search value, not a blind 20-country bulk run.
**Owner must:** Confirm final country list before generation.

### O2: Product comparison pages (`/compare/[slug1]-vs-[slug2]`)
**What:** Programmatic comparison pages for high-intent queries ("COSRX vs The Ordinary niacinamide")
**Why:** Bottom-of-funnel intent, Google AI Mode fan-out, internal cross-linking
**Risk:** Mass-generated thin pages can trigger quality penalties. Must be human-reviewed.
**Owner must:** Provide a curated list of 20–30 pairs before any code is written. Verify first 2 before bulk.

### O3: "Best [X] in Bangladesh" listicle pages (`/best/[slug]`)
**What:** 20 high-intent editorial pages ("best sunscreen for oily skin in Bangladesh")
**Why:** Captures informational + commercial queries Shajgoj currently owns
**Risk:** Same as O2 — needs curation and review, not mass generation
**Owner must:** Approve final topic list. Verify first 2 before bulk.

### O4: Skin-type pages (`/skin-type/[slug]`)
**What:** Curated pages for oily / dry / sensitive / combination skin
**Why:** Current skin-type handling lives as `/shop?skin_type=` filter → canonicalizes away
**Risk:** Doorway-page risk if thin. Only build if each page has genuine buying guidance.
**Owner must:** Confirm whether to build. 4 pages max (oily, dry, sensitive, combination).

## 🟢 LOW — Backlog (do when convenient)

### L1: Cloudflare cache rule for `/shop` and `/category/*`
Nginx sets `s-maxage` correctly. Cloudflare CDN rule still needs dashboard setup.
**Owner:** Dashboard-only task.

### L2: Critical CSS inlining (`critters`)
Main CSS (94KB / 16.8KB gzipped) blocks first paint on mobile slow-4G.
**Fix:** Add `critters` to Next.js build for above-fold CSS inlining.
**Effort:** Medium | **Risk:** Medium (build complexity)

### L3: `/brands` page is 785KB
Largest page in crawl. Consider lazy-loading brand logos or paginating.
**Effort:** Small

### L4: H2s missing on `/brands`, `/sale`, `/new-arrivals`
Minor structure gap. Adding section headings improves crawler comprehension.

### L5: Google-Extended bot policy
Currently allowed. Keep if LLM discoverability is wanted; block in robots.ts if not.
**Owner:** Business decision.

### L6: Blog content volume
**The real Shajgoj gap.** They have 400+ Bangla articles; we have 31.
This cannot be solved in a sprint — requires a sustained content calendar.
**Owner:** Content roadmap decision. Claude can assist with outlines and drafts on request.

## What Opus / Other AI Got Wrong (2026-05-19)

Record of AI analysis that was inaccurate — for reference when evaluating future AI SEO audits.

| Opus claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| og:type=website on product pages | Already fixed before Opus ran |
| priceValidUntil missing | Already fixed |
| GTIN/MPN missing | Already fixed |
| No aggregateRating handling | Correct as-is — omitting on zero-review products is right |
| Article schema missing on blog | Already implemented |
| ItemList schema missing | Already implemented on all collection pages |
| Homepage H1 rotating | Already fixed — stable brand H1 |
| 7 static pages no canonical | All canonicals present |
| Homepage/shop no og:image | Both have og:image |
| makeup-cosmetics no meta desc | Has a description |
| og:image missing on concerns/ingredients | All have og:image |
| References `/srv/hgc/memory-kit/` | Path does not exist on this VPS |
| References LLM pool at `/srv/hgc/ops/` | Does not exist on this VPS |
| "Next.js 15 at /var/www/wordpress" | Wrong path and wrong version |

**Lesson:** Always verify with curl before acting on AI SEO audits. This file's findings are curl-verified.
