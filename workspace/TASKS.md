## 📱 MOBILE EMERGENCY NOTE — 2026-06-05

**Starting tomorrow: Mobile App Live Procedure**

Internal flow:
```
Fix known bugs → Build signed AAB → Upload to Play Store internal track

→ 2 weeks → Open testing → 2 weeks → Production release
```

Key files:
- Build config: `workspace/docs/mobile-build-notes.md`
- API: all calls go through `https://e-mart.com.bd/api/mobile/*` (BFF layer)

- WC keys: confirm `key_id 34` (live BFF) is the only active key

Critical checks before build:
1. No `WOOCOMMERCE_KEY` / `WOOCOMMERCE_SECRET` in mobile code
2. `/api/mobile/products`, `/api/mobile/cart`, `/api/checkout` all respond 200
3. bKash + Nagad payment flows tested on staging device
