# Kbazar24 Task Board
Last updated: 2026-06-17 by Codex

## Coordination

- Open this project at `/root/kbazar24-platform` separately (not inside emart-platform).
- GitHub: `git@github-kbazar:shadinmominur-arch/kbazar24-platform.git` — uses dedicated SSH key `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_kbazar`.
- Deploy: `./deploy.sh` from `/root/kbazar24-platform` — has safety check to refuse if wrong repo.
- Before editing: `git status --short` and check `tail -20 apps/web/SESSION-LOG.md`.

## Owner Action Required

| Priority | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH | **Rotate ADMIN_PASSWORD** | `.env.local` still has `ADMIN_PASSWORD=Emart@2024!` — change to kbazar24-specific password |
| MEDIUM | **Add Cloudflare Access for WP admin** | Nginx basic auth is active now. Cloudflare Access would add another edge-layer control before paid ads |
| MEDIUM | **Rotate courier API keys** | Pathao + Packzy keys in `.env.local` are Emart's credentials — get kbazar24-specific keys |
| MEDIUM | **Disable Cloudflare AI Crawl Control** | CF is overriding `robots.txt`. Dashboard → kbazar24.com → Security → Bots → AI Crawl Control → Disable |
| LOW | **SPF + DMARC DNS records** | `TXT @ v=spf1 include:spf.brevo.com ~all` and `TXT _dmarc v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:kbazar24.bd@gmail.com` |

---

## Agent Tasks (no owner input needed)

| Priority | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH | **Product sitemap** | GSC only sees 101 pages. Add `/sitemap/products` route so 3,500+ PDPs are indexed faster |
| MEDIUM | **Upload category images** | Most categories show no image in storefront. Upload via WP Admin → Products → Categories |
| LOW | **Tune PHP-FPM capacity** | Logs showed `pm.max_children` warnings during Woo/API load. Check memory headroom before increasing |
| LOW | **Rename inherited asset paths** | Live HTML may still include cosmetic paths like `/images/brands-e-mart/...`; public copy/SEO is Kbazar |
